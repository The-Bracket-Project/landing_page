This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## 1. Branching Strategy

* Follow a branching strategy like GitFlow or GitHub Flow for effective collaboration.
* Create feature branches for developing new features or fixing bugs.
* Name branches descriptively, using a consistent naming convention (e.g., feature/<branch-name> or bugfix/<branch-name>).
## 2. Pull Requests

* Create a pull request (PR) for each significant change you want to merge into the main branch.
* Include a clear title and description in your PR, explaining the purpose and changes made.
* Assign appropriate reviewers to the PR for code review.
* Respond to review comments promptly and make necessary changes.
* Use the "Squash and Merge" or "Rebase and Merge" options to maintain a clean commit history.
  
## 3. Code Style and Quality

* Follow consistent code style guidelines agreed upon by the team (e.g., indentations, variable naming conventions).
* Utilize linters and code formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to ensure code quality and consistency.
* Write self-explanatory code and include comments for complex logic or important information.
* Write meaningful commit messages that summarize the changes made.
